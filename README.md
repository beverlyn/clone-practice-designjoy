# 🖥️ Clone a website 
This project is a practice exercise, where I cloned the landing page of an existing, fully operational website from scratch.

## 🌱 Background
In my journey to understand the foundation of good design, I thought it would be a good learning experience to clone a website crafted by a professional web designer. I wanted to challenge myself by cloning a working website, from the static elements to the dynamic animations.

## 📚 Learnings
I've documented my key learnings from this project on [Twitter](https://x.com/natsu_bee8/status/1736738891405865324?s=20).

While the majority of these insights are technical, some of which I've added to my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/beverlyn-the-vuer), the project also helped me develop beneficial habits and practices in web design.


## 🤔 Future plans
I hope to take what I've learned from this project and apply it to future frontend endeavors. I also had an enjoyable time learning how to create animations, so I'd also like to experiment with more animation styles, ranging from eye-catching to subtle.
